		<h1>Jessie's P1 topics</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Wushu Sanda: a martial arts I used to practice that no one seems to know about.</li>
				<li>Affordable cuts of steak: who has the money for steaks every week? Not college students. However, if you know which cuts to pick, you can have steaks for as low as $7/lbs.</li>
				<li>Tips for riding electric scooter safely on campus: I ride e-scooter daily to commute to school, and I think I've learned some tips about riding on campus that no youtuber has ever covered.</li>
